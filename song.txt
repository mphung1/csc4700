Old friend
It's me and you again
And old boy
As me and you rejoice
Yeah, I can't help thinking 'bout the way we joked
In those funeral homes, yeah
I could only hope it was appropriate
So make me laugh
As for my last request
If I don't take it back
Would you ignore my last request?
Oh, would you make me laugh?
As for my last request
Babe, I won't make it back
Yeah, I am sure there's nothing left
But as a, a reminder
Ready when you find her
I repress the iridescence of a fire
And won't you mind him?
Steady when you find him
I confess the incandescence of a dying light
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Consume me through the night
Old man
I'm done always abiding by the plan
And old boy
We knew you really never had a choice
But I can't help thinking 'bout the way we loved
I was cancer then, now I can hardly come to terms
Losing her
So would you make me laugh?
As for my last request
Babe, I won't make it back
Yeah, I am sure there's nothing left
As a, a reminder
Ready when you find her
I repress the iridescence of a fire
And won't you mind him?
Steady when you find him
I confess the incandescence of a dying light
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Consume me through the night
Oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
If I was the king of the thing
Then you could have it all
If you lied and called me your queen
Then you could have the dogs
If I was the swingingest thing
Then you could have a ball
Show me one more effort, boy
You know that I could make it better
If I was the king of the thing
Then you could have it all
If you lied and called me your queen
Then you could have the dogs
And if I was the only thing
You couldn't bear to lose
I'd set fire to the wood
Just so you wouldn't have to bury me too
A reminder
Ready when you find her
I repress the iridescence of a fire
And won't you mind him?
Steady when you find him
I confess the incandescence of a dying light
A reminder, ready when you find her
I repress the iridescence of a fire
And won't you mind him?
Steady when you find him
I confess the incandescence of a dying light
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Consume me through the night
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Consume me through the night
